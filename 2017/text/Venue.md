Joy of Coding 2017 will take place at the Rotterdamse Schouwburg, a theatre in the centre of Rotterdam.

The location is on the central Rotterdam square of the same name, _Schouwbergplein_.

## Getting there

Address: Rotterdamse Schouwburg, Schouwburgplein 25, 3012 CL Rotterdam

The venue is five minutesâ€™ walk from the front of the _Rotterdam Centraal_ train station, so public transport links are ideal.

## About Rotterdam

Rotterdam is a city from the future that is undergoing constant refactoring.
As in our code, legacy urban elements are continuously being replaced by more exciting modern structures.
The Erasmus bridge, Central Station, the Market Hall and the Timmerhuis are recent examples, but not the last.
Meanwhile, building reuse gives many historical monuments new roles.
