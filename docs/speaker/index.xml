      <description>The Joy of Stochastic Gradient Descent We’ll take a look at the joys of Deep Learning from its simple, elegant fundamentals to its feats of impressive power. Along the way, we’ll discuss how Deep Learning is changing how we approach programming, communicate with each other, and even what it means to be human.

      <description>Shaving the Golden Yak Programming is a series of frustrations. Everything we do, we could do better or faster if we only had our tools set up just so. If our error messages were a little better, our code a little cleaner, our tests a lot wider. How do you balance the work you’re supposed to be doing with the work that makes your work, work? Dive into the yak stack with me.</description>

      <description>Mob Programming If you think pair programming (2 people on 1 computer) is crazy, hold onto your hats; it’s time for Mob Programming.
Mob Programming: All the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same place, and on the same computer.
We are going to take a look at a new way of working, what it looks like, and why it can work.</description>

      <description>Stories Every Developer Should Know  &amp;ldquo;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&amp;rdquo; – George Santayana 
 &amp;ldquo;The past is never dead. It’s not even past.&amp;rdquo; – William Faulkner 
Most architects and developers pursue the Latest and Greatest with great fervor, yet the history of engineering, including software projects, contains rich lessons that we risk repeating ad nauseam. This keynote recounts a variety of stories of projects that failed architecturally…and why.</description>
