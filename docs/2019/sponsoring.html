       <h2 id="conference">The conference</h2>

      <p>Joy of Coding 2019 is the seventh edition in a series of conferences dedicated to the art, science, hobby, but most of all <em>the joy</em> of software development. This year’s edition will be held on Friday the 8th of June in the De Doelen, Rotterdam: a convention center at the heart of the city, easily accessible by public transport and by car.</p>

      <h2 id="mission">Our mission</h2>

      <p>We bring internationally renowned speakers to Rotterdam to deliver talks and workshops. They cover diverse aspects of the craft, reflecting recent trends in industry and academia, as well as a serious amount of joy. It’s a whole-day, fully-catered event at an affordable price. We keep the price low for attendees by running the conference as a non-profit organisation and by relying on our sponsors’ generous support, in addition to ticket sales.</p>

      <h2 id="audience">The audience</h2>

      <p>Joy of Coding attracts a loyal and growing audience that consists of hundreds of software developers — nearly 250 in 2018 — who are passionate about the code quality. In our experience, they are especially those of the more curious kind: eager to learn beyond their comfort zone, always striving to be up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques.</p>

      <h2 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h2>

      <p>The team behind Joy of Coding is an informal group of five people all working in IT, backed by a non-profit legal entity: the Devnology Foundation. We organise the event because it is fun and because we believe the Rotterdam programmer community needs this platform. To keep the event affordable, we rely heavily on our sponsors.</p>

      <p>Our supporters are usually companies based in or near Rotterdam, that employ programmers and take quality software development seriously. What our supporters have in common is that they understand how enabling the joy of coding and a passion for continuous learning results in highly successful software development teams.</p>

      <h2 id="packages">Supporter packages</h2>

      <p>We have two base packages which you can extend with one or more exclusive add-ons. Non-standard ways to support us are most welcome; more about this in the ‘Customized support’ section.</p>
