<div class="speaker-bio">
  
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles">Jason Scott Sadofsky</a> was born on September 13, 1970 to two very nice people who got along for a while and then not so much. Things get fuzzy for a while in there, but he definitely lived in a variety of homes in the Putnam and Westchester Counties in New York State and in various towns surrounding Boston, Massachusetts, which is where he’s located currently.</p>
<p>In 1998 he started a website called <a href="http://textfiles.com/">TEXTFILES.COM</a> whose original mission was to make available the thousands of BBS textfiles he’d collected in his youth, but which has now expanded greatly in all directions of computer history. Over the last decade the site has been host to millions of visitors and used frequently as a historical reference and lazy-day pastime. The collection, combined with all of its sub-sections, consists of over a terabyte of data.</p>
<p>In 2001, Jason began production on a video documentary about dial-up Bulletin Board Systems which was named simply “BBS: The Documentary”. Thousands of miles of travel, two hundred interviews, and 4 years later the film was released as a 5.5 hour mini-series on three DVDs.</p>
<p>In 2005, production began on two more documentaries: GET LAMP, a documentary about text adventures and the people/companies who created/create them, and ARCADE, a documentary about places of coin-operated entertainment.</p>
