<h1>Coding the Future Coders - Angie Jones</h1>
<div class="speaker-talk">
  <p>The joy of coding is something that’s difficult to explain. Coding is tedious, nerve-wrecking, and can be downright intimidating. Yet it’s exhilarating, rewarding, and has the ability to change the world as we know it. This joy that we have for tech is something that we can gift to others!</p>

  <p>As someone who didn’t know a single computer programmer growing up, software engineering is not something that I knew existed as a possible career path. I went to college clueless about what I wanted to do with my life and only took a computer programming course by chance. I immediately fell in love with coding and have been in love ever since.</p>

  <p>As a seasoned professional, I often think about young kids who are like me. Do they know this joy exists? What if they don’t stumble into programming as I did? Will they never know this joy that we get to experience daily?</p>

  <p>In this talk, I’ll share how I explored opportunities to gift the joy of coding to others; I’ll share ways that I give back with the limited amount of spare time that I do have; and I’ll share techniques on how to expose kids to complex topics such as machine learning, mobile app development, game design, and web animation with hands-on exercises.</p>
