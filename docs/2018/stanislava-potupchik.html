      <p>Games are a safe place where you can practice unusual behaviors without being afraid of the consequences. What is important for a facilitator is to help participants to transfer acquired sub-conscious knowledge into real-life patterns. In these five minutes I will do my best to ignite the spark of curiosity and give some advice about what every coder can learn from games.</p>

      <p>Serious games entered Stanislava’s life in 2000, when she had no idea that that’s what she was doing was called. Since then she worked as a facilitator of personal and group training using many games and gamified exercises to engage people and trigger them to change. Currently, Stanislava works as a Scrum master at Quby (Amsterdam) and is re-learning how to use her favourite tools in a different country, with IT and business people.</p>
