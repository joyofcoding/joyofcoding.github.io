      <p>All attendees, speakers, hosts, sponsors and volunteers (all these further referred to as participants) at our events are subject to the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code throughout all our events and are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

      <h2 id="harassment">No harassment</h2>
      <p>We are dedicated to providing harassment-free events for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>

      <h2 id="help">We will help</h2>
      <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organisers immediately. We will make sure that during our conferences the organisers can be easily identified, for example through recognisable t-shirts.</p>
      <p>If you are traveling to or from our event, and during the event, we will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of our event. We value your attendance and will take serious any issue that is in breach of this code of conduct.</p>

      <h2 id="content">No offensive content</h2>
      <p>It is not appropriate to associate offensive content such as sexual language and imagery with of our events in any form, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Speakers are asked to review their material and be considerate and friendly to a diverse audience.</p>

      <h2 id="alcohol">No alcohol abuse</h2>
      <p>Thanks to the help of our sponsors, there is usually some food and drinks available during or after our events. We hope this can be appreciated and used in good spirits, we do however ask you to drink responsibly.</p>

      <h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
      <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all our events and related social events. Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
