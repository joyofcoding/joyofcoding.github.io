RoboCup Junior is a robot competition for kids up to 19 years of age, with categories for soccer, rescue and dance.

Teams that compete in the dance division create both a robot and a dance composition for the robot to perform.
Each entry consists of a two-minute dance performance choreographed to music, with particular attention for construction and programming.
Team members can join in to dance alongside the robot.

At Joy of Coding, the Dutch champions of the RoboCup Junior 2017 dance division will perform their winning routine on stage.
